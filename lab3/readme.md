Given an undirected graph 
G=(V,E), the edge connectivity of graph G is defined as the minimum number of edges that, when removed, disconnect the graph. For example: <br>
Edge connectivity of a tree = 1 <br>
Edge connectivity of a cycle = 2 <br>
Edge connectivity of an n-clique = n-1 <br>
Develop and implement an algorithm to calculate the edge connectivity of the given graph G, using the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm.
