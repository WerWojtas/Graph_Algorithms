The given undirected graph is 
�
=
(
�
,
�
)
G=(V,E), with a function 
�
:
�
→
�
c:E→N assigning weights to edges, and distinguished vertices 
�
s and 
�
t. We are looking for a path from 
�
s to 
�
t such that the weight of the smallest edge on this path is maximized. The goal is to return the minimum weight of an edge on the found path.
